          Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
          Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja
          who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the
          Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts: the
          first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second
          in his teens (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two one-shot
          manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an
          honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following
          year, and Naruto (1997).
